                You have 1 week to accomplish the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it,
                but one of our colleagues tends to say: "Make sure it is good" ;-).
                Please send us (jobs@madewithlove.com) an email when you are ready with the assignment.
                Please mention your name, Github username and a link to what we need to review.
